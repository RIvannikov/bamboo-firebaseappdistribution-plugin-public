# Bamboo Firebase App Distribution Plugin

## Overview
Plugin for Atlassian Bamboo for uploading artifact files on Firebase using Firebase App Distribution API.

## Build
Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window: - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
* atlas-mvn package -- create package
